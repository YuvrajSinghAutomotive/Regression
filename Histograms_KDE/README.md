## Histograms and Kernel Density Estimates
Tutorial URL: [RealPython.com link](https://realpython.com/python-histograms/) <br>
Reference on using histograms and Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to examine/estimate the Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) of variables.<br>
<b>Why Estimate PDFs: </b> For a response variable, a probability distribution different from a normal or gaussian distribution may be the reason for regression algorithm to fail. Identifying the actual probability distribution is crucial to decide the generalized regression modeling method to use (For example: logistic regression would be used to predict response variables belonging to a binary distribution)
